# Paper Trading Pilot: P2/P3 Findings Follow-up

## Context

We completed a comprehensive code review of the paper trading pilot and addressed all 4 P1 (critical) findings. This session focuses on the remaining P2 and P3 findings.

**Prior work:**
- Commit `8eb8c64`: fix: address 4 P1 critical findings from code review
- All 148 unit tests passing

## Remaining Todos

### P2 (Medium Priority) - 5 items

| File | Issue | Risk |
|------|-------|------|
| `todos/005-pending-p2-15s-poll-interval-slow.md` | CoinGecko 15s poll interval too slow for arb detection | Missed opportunities |
| `todos/006-pending-p2-import-order-violation.md` | PEP8 import order violation in polymarket.py | Code quality |
| `todos/007-pending-p2-race-condition-batch-fetch.md` | Race condition in CoinGecko batch fetch | Data consistency |
| `todos/008-pending-p2-dashboard-no-api.md` | Dashboard is Streamlit-only, no REST API | Monitoring gaps |
| `todos/009-pending-p2-hardcoded-db-defaults.md` | Hardcoded database defaults in multiple places | Config drift |

### P3 (Low Priority) - 3 items

| File | Issue | Risk |
|------|-------|------|
| `todos/010-pending-p3-inconsistent-error-handling.md` | Inconsistent error handling patterns | Maintainability |
| `todos/011-pending-p3-dashboard-error-leaks-info.md` | Dashboard error messages may leak system info | Minor security |

## Instructions

1. Read each todo file: `cat todos/*-pending-*.md`
2. Triage: Decide which to fix now vs defer
3. For approved items, implement fixes
4. Run tests: `pytest tests/ -v`
5. Rename completed todos: `*-pending-*` → `*-complete-*`
6. Commit with descriptive message

## Quick Wins (Recommended)

- **006** (import order) - 2-line fix
- **009** (hardcoded defaults) - consolidate to settings

## Defer Candidates

- **008** (dashboard API) - larger scope, could be separate PR
